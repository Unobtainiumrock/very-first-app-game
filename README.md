# Very first app I ever made with my friends
Ahh nostalgia! Created by Tim Woo, Trevor Pace, and Nicholas Fleischhauer. This was my first app/game I made with my buddies in late 2015 or early 2016. It uses (Phaser.io)[http://phaser.io/].

## Instructions
After cloning this, run `npm install` and then run `npm start`, and finally nagivate to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

## Gameplay

### About
This game is very similar in difficulty and gameplay to [Helicopter](http://www.play-helicopter-game.com/) or [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). It becomes impossibly hard at some point, becasue the blocks continue to speed up.

### Controls
`left-click` causes the green player block to rise. By default, the block will fall rapdidly due to gravity.
